In Spring, those objects that form the backbone of your application and that 
are managed by the Spring IoC container are referred to as beans. 
A bean is simply an object that is instantiated, assembled and otherwise 
managed by a Spring IoC container; other than that, there is nothing special about 
a bean (it is in all other respects one of probably many objects in your application). 
These beans, and the dependencies between them, are reflected in the configuration metadata used by a container



Spring container is one type of Software that register Spring bean class for the Instantiation and then class is 
ready to execute.


Spring container register spring bean class by using id and fully qualified name.
